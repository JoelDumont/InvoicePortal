Decentraliced Billing Portal

This project is a decentralized web application (dApp) for securely creating, encrypting, sending, and paying invoices on the Ethereum/Moonbeam blockchain.

**Features**
- Invoices are encrypted client-side and stored on-chain in a smart contract.
- Recipients can decrypt their invoices using MetaMask.
- Invoices can be paid directly via MetaMask.
- No central storage – everything is handled via smart contract and wallet.

**Live on Moonbeam**

**Note**  
The app currently runs on Moonbeam and was developed on Moonbase Alpha. MetaMask is required
